    "prologue starts."

    #flashback to the federal who had to make the report to Judas about his daughter and her lover's death. He's on scene and speaking over the phone.
    #the scene is the room they killed themselves in. It's like some trashy motel room. rose petals, wine, etc. are all over the place.


    "prologue ends."
