#music to listen to for character consistency: 'I won't fall apart'

# - Behold! The long list of payton's ticks. - #
#information is gathered and later called back up. immersion, blaah blah. player feels like they know the characters and the characters know them.

## ---- general notes ---- ##
#payton prefers empty towns
#yvette likes poison. should get some moves that inflict poison later.
#Some person plugged into a machine from a tiny room doesn't make a folk hero.

#-- kind of a long note
#payton is a gender neutral name. m or f? leave it as a mystery before mc meets them. after they meet, give payton an ambiguous appearance, you know what I mean. Think totsuka.
#eventually, mc will say something. payton will ask if mc thought they were m or f all this time? the answer can affect what payton reveals themself as? is that too rude to the character?
#payton cam reveal themself as the opposite that mc had assumed. later, after mc leaves. show payton talking to yve. yve tells payton to stop messing with poor mc. it's implied payton was just going to say the opposite of whatever mc said. the mystery is unresolved.
#yve tells payton: you're too cruel.
#--
#mc "payton you talk a little weird.
#p "it bother you?"
#mc "no, but-"
#p "sry, ill try harder."
#"...what"
#--


# - relationship between payton and yvette - #
#least formal pair, they work more as partners. payton delegates things to yvette. so depending on the topic, you'll probably be talking mainly to one or the other. the other might jump in ofc.

#it feels weird to talk to you payton without ever having seen your face.
#payton says whatever, ask friday to describe me to you.
#friday's met you?
#payton says sure she has, etc. they met idk where
#...
#ask friday what payton looks like. friday gives a strange description that really clears nothing up. after, friday offers to draw a picture.
