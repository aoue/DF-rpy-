## ---- general notes ---- ##

#-- kind of a long note
#payton is a gender neutral name. m or f? leave it as a mystery before mc meets them. after they meet, give payton an ambiguous appearance, you know what I mean. Think totsuka.
#eventually, mc will say something. payton will ask if mc thought they were m or f all this time? the answer can affect what payton reveals themself as? is that too rude to the character?
#payton cam reveal themself as the opposite that mc had assumed. later, after mc leaves. show payton talking to yve. yve tells payton to stop messing with poor mc. it's implied payton was just going to say the opposite of whatever mc said. the mystery is unresolved.
#yve tells payton: you're too cruel.

#mc "payton you talk a little weird.
#p "it bother you?"
#mc "no, but-"
#p "sry, ill try harder."
#"...what"
