#notes:
#you have to announce your presence to friday/all operatives, because sometimes she's not sure if what she hears is real. mention this in passing/understated
#only we're real, etc
#misattribution of things to mc
#refusal to work with/listen to other people


#put all labels for friday;s events in here.
#friday's events are not just limited to when friday is back at the hq.
