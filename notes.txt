usually a song with the opposite mood of whatever scene I'm in.

==============================

char death:  character buildup -> loss -> grief -> call to action. Have an arc and feel present in the lives of the other characters prior to their death. So who is going to die? Let it be any combination of the characters, kind of like the suicide mission in ME 2. In the last dungeon, or at certain points, it is possible for a character to get a death check. It can end up just mc on his own at the end, where the shape changer will take pity on him.

#mc and Anne are both white-haired

#a self-centered-beauty.

##self-centered: focus on yourself in relation to the rest of the world.
##self-absorbed: focus on yourself with neglect to the rest of the world.

#i want to be a non-conformist like everybody else

#Greeks trade with other Greeks

#-gap: finding it cute when characters act in a way different from their usual character. is it cancer? you decide.
^pretty sure its cancer.

#-snow under snow: this is a writing technique, used to misdirect.
e.g.
snow: you think a character is crying because of EVENT. mc goes to see what's wrong.
under: they are crying because they're listening to sad music/audio book that mc couldn't see. Misdirection.
snow: but why were they listening to something sad? Because of EVENT.
^it's misdirection that ties back. mostly it's fun to say snow under snow and to explain it.

#-central and sub antagonists:
the central antagonist is the main conflict.
the sub antagonist delivers the conflict to the protagonists. The central antagonist gives the sub antagonist agency.
eg. The emperor and Darth Vader
