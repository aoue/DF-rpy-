music I listened to while working:
-blue destination (cs2)
-Such Great Heights
-A cat relaxing in the sun (sky)
-Shreksophone
-Gandalf sax guy
-Salvage
-The district sleeps alone tonight
-diggy diggy hole
-shine on you crazy diamond

usually a song with the opposite mood of whatever scene I'm in.

==============================



to get around mc having no name: if hes gets a nickname through events that happen in the story, then the player will have ownership of it. So that needs to happen.

add in time skips and stuff. no need to go over everything in minute detail. Don't go back right now; we have to keep advancing.

mirrors are cheating.

i could draw the whole thing in black and white. startling white and deep black. there's a lot of wiggle room between them.

Flashbacks: greyed over versus black and white. both are neat. black and white has some style.

no cars. individual autonomy is not encouraged by the KBA. people take the f-trains, it's free, but slow. the rich take the m-train. costs money, but fast.

on brainwashing: what's the point? find someone who will do it and thank you for it. worst of all, it takes away that creative viciousness that an exceptional fighter has.

no pov switches. it may be tempting, but this should be a personal story. changing pov and giving the player access to more knowledge distances them from mc. Does it?

#mc and ane are both white-haired

#some argument: (mc is wrong here, obviously)
#person: i couldnt help doing it, i-
#mc: theres no such thing as that. distancing yourself from your actions does not absolve you of them.
#person: [...] in that case i pity you. to think all this time you have never been drawn into an action you couldnt resist. thats hardly living.
#mc: i like being in control.
#person: you dont like anything at all, except possibly yourself.

#mc is terrified of losing the watch and is therefore irrational and paranoid in matters that concern it. why though?
#later he's terrified of losing all the final letters he's carrying for people. friends will try to convince him to share them around.
#he refuses, saying he's the only one he knows for sure won't die. the rest of you are already dead.

#menu: "bluff but prepare to fight":
    smart villain "your stance betrays your true intentions. You're planning fighting."

#a self-centered-beauty.

##mc and nai are incapable of doing things simply.

##self-centered: focus on yourself in relation to the rest of the world.
##self-absorbed: focus on yourself with neglect to the rest of the world.

#god is a show-off. think to that convo in fate zero

#i want to be a non-conformist like everybody else

#greeks trade with other greeks

#####writing things to keep in mind#####
#-gap: finding it cute when characters act in a way different from their usual character. is it cancer? you decide.
^pretty sure its cancer.

#-snow under snow: this is a writing technique, used to misdirect. named after yukino from oregairu. this is what it is:
e.g.
snow: you think a character is crying because of EVENT. mc goes to see what's wrong.
under: they are crying because they're listening to sad music/audio book that mc couldn't see. Misdirection.
snow: but why were they listening to something sad? Because of EVENT.
^it's misdirection that ties back. mostly it's fun to say snow under snow and to explain it.

#-central and sub antagonists:
the central antagonist is the main conflict.
the sub antagonist delivers the conflict to the protagonists. The central antagonist gives the sub antagonist agency.
eg. Palp and Vader
in our case:
-central antagonist: the war?
-sub antagonist: lots of different ones.
