#these are the letters to our dear friday
#they should end with return, as they will be called, not jumped too.
#letters are to be used as exposition, but they should show up.
#add a gate to make sure the letter is not called twice by accident.

#who is friday:
#not dead, thats a cop-out
#far away?
#older sister/friend/mentor/guardian?
#doesn't exist?

#why is mc writing to friday as if she's dead?
#a few possible reasons, all tentative:
#shes not writing back?
#its easier to be honest to the dead?

#######display:
#dislay the whole letter at once is superior i believe. does this mean it should be an image, or display a ton of nvl with {nw}
#all the letters should be available to be reread in the actions screen
