
#tracks rels between different characters.
#what is a rel?
#a rel is how two characters feel towards each other. high is like, low is dislike. the characters' relationship shares a single variable.

#things to keep track of in general are:
#mc with everyone.
#how members of the main cast feel towards each other member of the main cast.
#how a member of the main cast feels towards their secondary character link.

#there's going to be a lot, so only add them once they matter. More interactions can be added later.
