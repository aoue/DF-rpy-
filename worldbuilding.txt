modern setting in a fictional world:

#------------------------------------------------#
geography:
river at the border: the Sineb. it runs from the ocean to a lake deep in the heartland of MC's country.
fortress near the border: Lafalais
capital: Sarrenais
the country is divided into three regions. geographically, they sit on top of each other, north -> central -> south.
region names:
north - Greater Sarrenais region (where mc is from. plains, cold.)
central - Greater Donnlier region (this is also where Larisse is. mountainous)
south - Greater Southern region (where lafalais and the sineb are. a lot of plains.)

#------------------------------------------------#

#name of the city: Donnlier
#name of the town: Larisse
-but: base the town's design of off Iqaluit. You can see it on maps. pop 8000, neat geography/sprawl. I like it.

Think of the Dresden bombings.
Donnlier is a rapidly growing city. People are flocking to it from the countryside amid urbanization and the towns that were once separate are now suburbs
When it is destroyed, Larissa is destroyed as well due to its vicinity. The pilots didn't even know what it was.


the town:
vibrant worlds have lots of side characters:
the lost and found gang - they can be found at the lost and found room.
the table arm wrestlers - they can be found everywhere, even places where they might not belong.
you should also get the chance to see every character out of their natural environment at least once.
locations:
archives and library
mc's apartment (have it change from "Ane's apartment" to "my apartment" perhaps?)
campus grounds
dorms
various streets
cafe(s)
lost and found
philosophy and ethics building
composition building
hotel



#------------------------------------------------#

make the presence of soldiers and whatnot known. See convoys, smoke, people know people.
people talk about the war, talk shows, political shows, radio shows.
ex: Thirdday, there's a general order to clear all streets from time a to time b to allow a convoy through.


#------------------------------------------------
politics:
Run by the lord-chairman. (named earnest?)
seconded by the advisor-secretary.
historian-general. privy to some malformed elements of history. head of a division of the army.
high ranking military personnel are doctors (as in phd.)

the first army: answers directly to the lord-chairman.
the second army: previously a reserve and brought up into a full army at the start of the war. answers directly to the advisor-secretary.
third army:
