------the very next thing(s)------

write enemy AI.

scale enemy units to player level? Or, enter a level variable for the unit to scale its stats.
random naming for enemies
write random placement function for enemy units.
-not really random, but just make sure enemy units don't always end up in the same spots. front units should still end up in front.

write moves for tutorial.
-federal- 4 moves
-federal aide- 4 moves.
-enemies (mutant animals, a few types. big mutant animal. two types of guard.)

when showing damage, show if any stances activated or were applied or wore off
^also, damage only shows up on one unit even if many are hit
^also, show the name of the move used somewhere. allow it to be moused over so the player can learn about it.

when hovering on a unit:
-show hp out of max
-show stamina out of max
-show able of out max. (little boxes. filled in means able, empty with a bar through it means that able was spent.)
-show dodge out of max
-show stances applied
-show move set
    on move hover:
    -show move targeting diagram
    -show power
    -show stamina drain
    -show able drain

------what needs doing-------

gear. there will be a weapon attack, hit value, an armor defense/dodge value. these will need to be added into the damage formula.

reposition battlefield information

leveling up (increase stats + learn moves)

unit passive abilities. (can be stances, i.e. stance 0 and stance 1, which will never be decremented when the others are.)

moves (pick and choose before battle. adjust moves once you click the unit in deploy screen but before clicking the spot. show the changes options with show screen)

hover over a move: power, element, physical or magical, diagram of what it hits, clearance, flavor text, stamina/able drain,

create full move sets

a battle log on the right or something?

stances (implement their effects)

AI (so you can fight a mock battle)

combat test (full on)

inventory system (acquire and change gear. should be easy. make an inventory list and just whatever.)

make the dungeon crawler interface (just images of interconnecting rooms, where each room is an image button and it shows up if you've explored it, and is clickable if you're adjacent. use a 2d array for this too.)

make the glossary (cannibalize the letter viewport grid)

make the town map.

figure out why my Unicode characters aren't working. ex: \u2603 should be a snowman

blender grease pencil. can interpolate animations. I can make all my still images animated. both for in combat and out. even the backgrounds can be animated.
---------------------------------
combat thingies:

each unit can have some passives. 2? that is, equipped at once. they can have a larger pool available.
e.g. bad connotations. Not good things to be.
 -sadist: regain some stamina on kill.
 -masochist: regain some stamina when damaged.
 -bloodhungry: regain some able on kill
 -egoist: enemies more likely to target you (weight the inevitable get target priority function)
 -cowardly: if another ally is in area of effect of enemy attack, act like this unit is not. (i.e. don't split the damage.)


combo moves:
-each time the unit uses a 'combo move', increase combo counter.
-combo moves deal .x? extra damage per combo counter.
-reset combo counter to 0 at the end of a round.

some units might get stuck. <- fix this.
^a swap phase after attacking, where you can move 1 unit 1 space. also helps with making tactical dodges/slight rearrangements.

defeated allies stay on the board. they can be revived.
defeated enemies go off the board.

enemy reinforcements during a battle

switching out a unit midbattle for one in reserve?
