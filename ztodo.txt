------the very next thing(s)------

unequip moves. in move swap, add a new button that swaps the move with None.
-don't add the 'none equipment' to the inventory

inventory mix up. it's probably something off with the flags. weapons -> armour, armour -> nothing.

when initializing a unit, set hp, dodge, etc, to the actual value. need to do for: federal, aide, jowler, groskel

only call a room's when entering if the room is not explored.

level up screen, focus, and level up.
-level cap? it would be increased by clearing achievements or something. i.e. kill optional bosses, complete optional missions. of course,  it will increase as the story progresses too. it means the player can't just power level past any challenge in the mechanics.
-level up screen, dramatic pose.
-if it's a choose your focus level-up. then do a very dramatic picture (press a to grab destiny) with buttons, one for each focus. "unit name stands at a crossroads."
    -when a focus is chosen, unlock a flashback for that character's backstory that can be viewed back at the hub. one flashback per focus per time chosen. the flashback has to do with the focus, obviously.
    -it should be clear that a focus influences story, in the way that the character responds.

overworld map:
hub:
 -room selection on the bottom
 -crafting
 -talk to all the other characters
 -call meeting

handler's textbox. on the side. shows up while the other textbox is still on screen. there can be two conversations ongoing at once.
we can also use if for phone calls.

move passives. Call:
-start of round.
-when a unit attacks
-when a unit is attacked

for some reason, sometimes damage is dealt in floats. don't know why. fix it by returning the integer function of the damage value. might be in the round function for spread in the calculate damage function. That's my best guess.

combat view:
what there is now will not work. ideas:
 -how about a mostly overhead view, where we see the backs of our own units and the fronts of the enemy.
 -show all the backs of our units close to the screen and the fronts of the enemy too, all lined up against each other. Then, off to the side, or maybe overlaid but semi-transparent, have the current map view that we've got now so the player can actually tell what's going on. I kind of like the semi-transparent but right in the center middle idea.
 -fire emblem 7 size/style sprites

------what needs doing-------
should weapons also affect defense/dodge and armor affects offense/hit? makes for more interesting gear. think on it.

evo moves/special moves/whatever if we're doing them. like ebf's limit breaks. move 8. a unit may acquire multiple, you have to equip/manage it like everything else.
-once a unit has filled its special gauge or whatever, it MUST use it's limit break on its next turn. no holding on to it. resets at the start of each battle.

hard cap on buffs? I don't see why. Rather than hard capping buffs, they should just be designed to be impractical.

unit passive abilities. (can be stances, i.e. stance 0 and stance 1, which will never be decremented when the others are.)


hover over a move: power, element, physical or magical, diagram of what it hits, clearance, flavor text, stamina/able drain,

a battle log on the right or something?

inventory system (acquire and change gear. should be easy. make an inventory list and just whatever.)

make the glossary (cannibalize the letter viewport grid)

figure out why my Unicode characters aren't working. ex: \u2603 should be a snowman

blender grease pencil. can interpolate animations. try this with the scarf animation from before.
---------------------------------
combat thingies:

each unit can have some passives. 2? that is, equipped at once. they can have a larger pool available.
e.g. bad connotations. Not good things to be.
 -sadist: regain some stamina on kill.
 -masochist: regain some stamina when damaged.
 -bloodhungry: regain some able on kill
 -egoist: enemies more likely to target you (weight the inevitable get target priority function)

combo moves:
-each time the unit uses a 'combo move', increase combo counter.
-combo moves deal .x? extra damage per combo counter.
-reset combo counter to 0 at the end of a round.

defeated allies stay on the board. they can be revived.
defeated enemies go off the board.

enemy reinforcements during a battle

switching out a unit midbattle for one in reserve?
