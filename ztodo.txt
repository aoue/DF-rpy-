------the very next thing(s)------

add a back button. two:
-when a unit's selected
-when a move's selected

when hovering on a unit: (show units screen. add a 'hovered' into the loop there. when hovered)
-show hp out of max
-show stamina out of max
-show able of out max. (little boxes. filled in means able, empty with a bar through it means that able was spent.)
-show dodge out of max
-show stances applied
-show move set
    on move hover:
    -show move targeting diagram
    -show power, hit, and damage type
    -show stamina drain
    -show able drain

overworld map: towns and stuff.

dungeon crawler.

------what needs doing-------

hard cap on buffs?

gear. weapon: attack, hit. armor: defense, dodge. add to damage formula.

leveling up (increase stats + learn moves)

unit passive abilities. (can be stances, i.e. stance 0 and stance 1, which will never be decremented when the others are.)

moves (pick and choose before battle. adjust moves once you click the unit in deploy screen but before clicking the spot. show the changes options with show screen)

hover over a move: power, element, physical or magical, diagram of what it hits, clearance, flavor text, stamina/able drain,

create full move sets

a battle log on the right or something?

stances (implement their effects)

AI (so you can fight a mock battle)

combat test (full on)

inventory system (acquire and change gear. should be easy. make an inventory list and just whatever.)

make the dungeon crawler interface (just images of interconnecting rooms, where each room is an image button and it shows up if you've explored it, and is clickable if you're adjacent. use a 2d array for this too.)

make the glossary (cannibalize the letter viewport grid)

make the town map.

figure out why my Unicode characters aren't working. ex: \u2603 should be a snowman

blender grease pencil. can interpolate animations. I can make all my still images animated. both for in combat and out. even the backgrounds can be animated.
---------------------------------
combat thingies:

each unit can have some passives. 2? that is, equipped at once. they can have a larger pool available.
e.g. bad connotations. Not good things to be.
 -sadist: regain some stamina on kill.
 -masochist: regain some stamina when damaged.
 -bloodhungry: regain some able on kill
 -egoist: enemies more likely to target you (weight the inevitable get target priority function)

combo moves:
-each time the unit uses a 'combo move', increase combo counter.
-combo moves deal .x? extra damage per combo counter.
-reset combo counter to 0 at the end of a round.

defeated allies stay on the board. they can be revived.
defeated enemies go off the board.

enemy reinforcements during a battle

switching out a unit midbattle for one in reserve?
