Things to keep in mind:
-anywhere there is a 'renpy.call', it should be a 'renpy.call_in_new_context.' this allows us to use return in the label instead of return the whole damn world.
-if saving breaks (pickling), there's some steps at the top of battle.rpy that might be useful

------Dungeon things to add-------

save room. in dungeons, can only save in this room?

keys are kept track of:
    -in the 'key item' list could then be searched for the correct key. the correct key would have to be known by the room.
    -the room looks for an integer in the key item list, which is really just a list of integers. if the room finds a matching integer to its own lock number, then it will unlock.

------Things needed for prologue release------

-art-
party portraits: federal, aide
character portraits: yve, handler, federal, aide, nai
backgrounds: taxi, hotel entrace, hotel desk, nai's office
dungeon backgrounds: generic rooms, idk what else exactly
music: at least one battle track and one vn track would be nice.

-code-
dungeon: rooms, room events. (they need writing too)
enemies: lord historian's grunt, lord historian's squad leader.
ai: healing. human squads usually have a healer in the group.
gear: loot after battle, treasure chests, stuff like that.
focus: yve's stat growth and learnset from level 1 through 10.
write: all the story



------the very next thing(s)------


inventory:
    -all spots in inventory lists to be redone as tuples. (object, quantity)

escape from battle. it can only be used when all your units are at full able (i.e. at the start of a round.) it sets all units' able to zero and you have to wait out the enemy's attacks. next round, end the combat as normal. increase threat by like 3x normal amount or something.

inventory:
    -using items in battle
    -using items in dungeon

the preferences menu. change it or something.
 all we need is:
    -text speed
    -history
    -?

clicking on the overworld 'backstreets' button should change the overworld background to the backstreets, which has some buttons and stuff, etc.
quick travel menu? has all the locations and they can be zoomed to with just a click.

key inventory and unlocking doors. do it.

focus list. it's the list of every focus the unit has access to.

change adrenaline. it's too useful. each of yve's adrenaline-type moves should only have one thing:
    -hp
    -physa
    -dodge and hit
    they'll all have the same adrenaline marker in stance though, so you can't apply them all at the same time.



------what needs doing eventually-------

crafting

shops:
 -gear
 -information (moves)
 -utility (chest keys, false alarms[lower threat in a dungeon], healing items, restore energy items.)

use items in battle.

overworld: hub. needed for chapter 1.

evo moves

combat view:
what there is now will not work. don't worry about it for now.
ideas:
 -how about a mostly overhead view, where we see the backs of our own units and the fronts of the enemy.
 -show all the backs of our units close to the screen and the fronts of the enemy too, all lined up against each other. Then, off to the side, or maybe overlaid but semi-transparent, have the current map view that we've got now so the player can actually tell what's going on. I kind of like the semi-transparent but right in the center middle idea.
 -fire emblem 7 size/style sprites

battle log? [unit name] uses [move name] and hits [target name] for [damage, effect] (list multiple targets too.) Would be a scrollable viewport kind of thing.

figure out why my Unicode characters aren't working. ex: \u2603 should be a snowman

---------------------------------
combat thingies:

combo moves:
 -each time the unit uses a 'combo move', increase combo counter.
 -combo moves deal .x? extra damage per combo counter.
 -reset combo counter to 0 at the end of a round (or just decrease it?)

defeated allies stay on the board. they can be revived.
defeated enemies go off the board.
