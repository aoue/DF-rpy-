Things to keep in mind:
-anywhere there is a 'renpy.call', it should be a 'renpy.call_in_new_context.' this allows us to use return in the label instead of return the whole damn world.
-if saving breaks (pickling), there's some steps at the top of battle.rpy that might be useful

------Dungeon things to add-------

save room? in dungeons, can only save in this room? we'll need to implement some kind of save control in at some point, in any case.

Saving in the hub? that's good because it gets the player back to the hub often, and of their own will.

------Things needed for prologue release------

-art-
party portraits: friday, federal, aide.
character portraits: yve, friday, payton cutin, mueler, federal, aide
backgrounds: taxi, hotel entrace, hotel desk, nai's office
dungeon backgrounds: generic rooms, idk what else exactly
music: at least one battle track and one event track would be nice.

-code-
overworld: switching overworld backgrounds when backstreets is clicked.
ai: healing. human squads usually have a healer in the group.
units: yve and friday need leveling from 1 to 10. yve starts at a higher level than friday.
write: all the story, the room events too.

design the whole dungeon. create all the event labels. then fill them up.



------the very next thing(s)------

each unit has two passives: gear passive and intrinsic passive.
intrinsic passive can only come from learned passive list/pool. These can be to represent the handler. [0]
gear passive can only come from gear. much more mundane passives. [1]

combat lanes. a unit in row x can only target a hex in rows x-1, x, x+1. is this even a good change, though?

inventory:
    -using items in battle
    -using items in dungeon

the preferences menu. change it or something.
 all we need is:
    -text speed
    -history
    -what else?


focus list. it's the list of every focus the unit has access to. it is useful for when a unit is on a focus level up. the unit chooses a focus from this list.


------what needs doing eventually-------

crafting

shops:
 -gear
 -information (moves)
 -utility (chest keys, false alarms[lower threat in a dungeon], healing items, restore energy items.)

use items in battle.

overworld: hub. needed for chapter 1.

escape from battle. it can only be used when all your units are at full able (i.e. at the start of a round.) it sets all units' able to zero and you have to wait out the enemy's attacks. next round, end the combat as normal. increase threat by like 3x normal amount or something.

evo moves

combat view:
what there is now will not work. don't worry about it for now.
ideas:
 -how about a mostly overhead view, where we see the backs of our own units and the fronts of the enemy.
 -show all the backs of our units close to the screen and the fronts of the enemy too, all lined up against each other. Then, off to the side, or maybe overlaid but semi-transparent, have the current map view that we've got now so the player can actually tell what's going on. I kind of like the semi-transparent but right in the center middle idea.
 -fire emblem 7 size/style sprites
 -acknowledge they are just boxes on the screen. make it look like a box with the character's cut in on it and name. like a token from a board game.

battle log? [unit name] uses [move name] and hits [target name] for [damage, effect] (list multiple targets too.) Would be a scrollable viewport kind of thing.

figure out why my Unicode characters aren't working. ex: \u2603 should be a snowman

---------------------------------
combat thingies:

combo moves:
 -each time the unit uses a 'combo move', increase combo counter.
 -combo moves deal .x? extra damage per combo counter.
 -reset combo counter to 0 at the end of a round (or just decrease it?)

defeated allies stay on the board. they can be revived.
defeated enemies go off the board.
