------the very next thing(s)------

direction screen:
 -position the different things
 -make a frame for the background.

when hovering on a unit on the battlefield: (show units)
draw a box around the unit's stats on the sidebar. so the player knows which stats refer to which unit.
show detailed browse:
    position (based on unit's position. it should be nearby.)
    -show hit points out of max
    -show energy out of max
    -show stamina out of max
    -show able of out max
    -show dodge out of max
    -show stances applied
    -show move set
        on move hover:
        -call the move browse screen. we made it already.

the unit's images should be smaller. it's hard to see the tile borders. (120 x 60)?

room icons. when a room is explored, show its icon variable on it. these mark certain types of rooms.
if the room is not explored, show a question mark icon on it.
special recurring room types:
 -entrance/exit
 -locked door
 -one time heal room
 -full heal room
 -staircase room
 -sleeping monster room (a boss that you don't have to fight immediately. you can come back for it.)

dungeon map:
 -leave the map and return to the overworld.
 -call starting room event as soon as we enter the place.
 -use out of combat moves: heal, teleport, etc. (add variable to move: out of combat. then, for every move the unit knows, if out of combat == 1, then show move button.)

focus and level up
-level cap? it would be increased by clearing achievements or something. i.e. kill 10 of this monster type, kill optional bosses, complete optional missions. of course,  it will increase as the story progresses too. it means the player can't just power level past any challenge in the mechanics.
-level up screen, dramatic pose.
-if it's a choose your focus level-up. then do a very dramatic picture with buttons, one for each focus. "so-and-so stands at a crossroads."
    -when a focus is chosen, unlock a flashback for that character's backstory that can be viewed back at the hub. one flashback per focus per time chosen. the flashback has to do with the focus, obviously.
    -it should be clear that a focus influences story, in the way that the character responds.




overworld map:
-direction: side quests, notes. quests are called 'directions.' notes are like things the characters observed, so the player doesn't have to remember everything. different notes will be taken by different characters. a little char building. Side bar: one tab for each chapter, and each chapter has a variety of missions, etc, across the top. Click a mission to see its page and any notes characters have taken.
-hub: where the group is gathered. join it to open a hub, where the player can click on characters to talk to them with the current POV character. click here to progress overworld state. click bottom tab to change rooms. see squad mates there.

move passives. Call:
-start of round.
-when a unit attacks
-when a unit is attacked


affinities. We need some more/just redo them maybe?
-beast
-armored <-- (u)

for some reason, sometimes damage is dealt in floats. don't know why. fix it by returning the integer function of the damage value.

combat view:
what there is now will not work. ideas:
 -how about a mostly overhead view, where we see the backs of our own units and the fronts of the enemy.
 -show all the backs of our units close to the screen and the fronts of the enemy too, all lined up against each other. Then, off to the side, or maybe overlaid but semi-transparent, have the current map view that we've got now so the player can actually tell what's going on. I kind of like the semi-transparent but right in the center middle idea.
 -fire emblem 7 size/style sprites

------what needs doing-------
should weapons also affect defense/dodge and armor affects offense/hit? makes for more interesting gear. think on it.

evo moves/special moves/whatever if we're doing them. like ebf's limit breaks. move 8. a unit may acquire multiple, you have to equip/manage it like everything else.
-once a unit has filled its special gauge or whatever, it MUST use it's limit break on its next turn. no holding on to it. resets at the start of each battle.

hard cap on buffs? I don't see why. Rather than hard capping buffs, they should just be designed to be impractical.

unit passive abilities. (can be stances, i.e. stance 0 and stance 1, which will never be decremented when the others are.)


hover over a move: power, element, physical or magical, diagram of what it hits, clearance, flavor text, stamina/able drain,

a battle log on the right or something?

inventory system (acquire and change gear. should be easy. make an inventory list and just whatever.)

make the glossary (cannibalize the letter viewport grid)

figure out why my Unicode characters aren't working. ex: \u2603 should be a snowman

blender grease pencil. can interpolate animations. try this with the scarf animation from before.
---------------------------------
combat thingies:

each unit can have some passives. 2? that is, equipped at once. they can have a larger pool available.
e.g. bad connotations. Not good things to be.
 -sadist: regain some stamina on kill.
 -masochist: regain some stamina when damaged.
 -bloodhungry: regain some able on kill
 -egoist: enemies more likely to target you (weight the inevitable get target priority function)

combo moves:
-each time the unit uses a 'combo move', increase combo counter.
-combo moves deal .x? extra damage per combo counter.
-reset combo counter to 0 at the end of a round.

defeated allies stay on the board. they can be revived.
defeated enemies go off the board.

enemy reinforcements during a battle

switching out a unit midbattle for one in reserve?
